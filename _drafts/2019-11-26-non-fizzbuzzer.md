excerpt: "Hidden dangers in a career in software development"
---

In my perspective, one of the most important things for a career in software is continued learning. Even after getting past entry-level, software engineers have to continually learn new technologies and the principles that underlie them.

## What I mean when I say Non-Fizzbuzzer
Though the term "non-fizzbuzzer" technically means someone who cannot write a simple program (e.g. [FizzBuzz](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/fizz-buzz-implementation/)), in this post I'm interpreting it to mean someone who has caught themselves on the wrong side of the learning dynamics of software engineering.

Someone who, instead of getting the positive benefits of continued investment in learning, has found themselves in intellectual debt. A resume filled with technologies that are no longer in demand. An ability to program or reason about software that is significantly lower than their resume would suggest. Difficulty implementing programs from scratch in the langauge of their choice.

## Non-learning as a compounding problem
Unfortunately, like any debt, ... compounds over time. ...

## how it happens
-leaving the hard stuff to the experts (e.g. google)
-copy-paste code -- modify it until things run
-if something doesn't work, use blind trial and error to solve it
-stick to your comfort zone - become an expert in one thing and then milk it
-avoid domains that you're unfamiliar with
-consider it unnecessary or beneath you to learn about these domains
-get today's project done as quickly as possible, don't waste time learning how things work underneath
-rely heavily on your company's existing tools and frameworks - if at all possible, avoid understanding what's inside any of the systems you're using
- avoid reading documentation or spending time learning
- don't waste time on the fundamentals
