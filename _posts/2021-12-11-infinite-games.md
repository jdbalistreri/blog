I just finished the book, Finite and Infinite Games, by James P. Carse. And by finished, I mean I decided to stop reading it.

I was 120 pages into a 150 page book, and I had already concluded that I didn't like the book. In fact, I knew that in the first 20 pages, but at that point I wasn't ready to let go of my desire to finish the book. Still, it's progress.

A good sign for me that it's time to put a book down is when I not only don't look forward to reading that book anymore, but I start to become less interested in reading in general. Granted, I've probably only done this successfully <5 times in the last 3 years.

This attitude of doing something primarily for the outcome is ironically a core subject of Finite and Infinite games. It's also extremely common in our culture, and in my life. And it's something I've been taking a closer look at recently.

If I've decided that the primary benefit of reading a book is to complete it, then I'm already wishing that the reading process were over. There's no value in the act of reading, except as a means to completing the book. And it would be best if the process ended as quickly and efficiently as possible. Even better would be to fast-forward through that process and immediately be at the end.

This attitude is a kind of death. Denying the value of my experience, and closing myself off from the possibilities that continually bubble up each moment.

What might I experience moment to moment as I'm reading the book? How might I be moved or changed? What if I decide it's time to stop reading or do to something else entirely?

When I've had glimpses of this way of living, the world seems wildly exciting and full of possibility. I might feel anything, do anything, be anything. Which is also terrifying, and perhaps why it's so hard to step out of my head and into my body.
