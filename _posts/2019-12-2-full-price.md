excerpt: "Why it's better to avoid things that have been artificially subsidized"
---

I decided recently to stop using my family's shared Netflix account, and it's helped me clarify my views around avoiding things that are artificially subsidized or free.

## Background on the Netflix account
Many years ago, my family got a Netflix account that my parents, my three siblings, and I all shared. My parents originally paid for the account, and continued to do so, but they'd occassionally question if they should keep paying for a service used by their adult children.

When the topic would come up, my immediate, instinctive reaction would be "oh no, I hope they don't stop paying for it!"

## The hidden cost of free
And that's where the hidden costs come in. Netflix costs about $9/month, and I'm fortunate enough that I could pay for it on my own without it affecting my finances.

However, asking myself if I'd be willing to pay the full price for Netflix makes me question the entire premise.

Is watching Netflix something I want in my life?

Is it worth $9/month?

But most importantly, is it worth my time?

## My true preferences
When it comes down to it, I'm not currently willing to spend the money for Netflix, because it's not something I really value.

And in fact, the idea of not having access to Netflix excites me, thinking about the things I might do instead of watching TV.

And the reason I didn't question it sooner is that I didn't want to lose access to something "free".

## You get a car
Taking the point beyond this example, our society is full of seemingly free or subsidized stuff:
  * cheap food
  * free or subsidized education
  * free news
  * free social media
  * free porn
  * free smartphone games

This also applies to the dynamics of individual relationships (families, friendships, romantic relationships, employment arrangements, etc.)

## Pay the full price
So does this mean I should avoid anything that's free?

No, I don't think so. And I'm also not saying that being free makes something inherently bad.

Instead, I plan to ask myself if I'd be willing to pay the full price for anything I think I'm getting for free.

The most important part of that exercise is truly understanding what the full price is.

So for now, I'm done with Netflix. And if I ever change my mind, I can always pay the $9/month to get it back.
