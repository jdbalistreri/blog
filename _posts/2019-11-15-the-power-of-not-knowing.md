excerpt: "Coming to grips with how little I know about software"

My software career has often felt like an uphill battle against all the things I don't know.

## Getting the job done
I became a software engineer after attending [App Academy](https://www.appacademy.io/), a coding bootcamp where I learned just enough about coding in 12 weeks to pass an interview and land a job.

At first when I started working full time, it was easy to ask for help and admit the things I didn't know. I had never used Go (the coding language that my team worked in), I didn't know anything about distributed systems, and my grasp on things like networking or databases was hazy at best.

However, after a few months, people started to trust me to get things done, and I became more and more reluctant to ask questions. What if they remembered that I didn't know anything and I lost the credibility I had earned?

I remember one meeting where I didn't understand a word people on my team were talking about, and I just sat there and nodded.

## Pumping the brakes
This situation progressed until I was on the verge of getting my first promotion. I was doing well at my job, but my technical knowledge hadn't grown much. I was focusing on my pre-existing strengths and avoiding my weaknesses, careful to avoid letting anyone know how much I was winging it.

I had fears of eventually becoming a senior engineer who couldn't explain something like how HTTP works. (I still don't entirely know!) And I became increasingly stressed at work, verging on burnout.

Eventually, I realized that I was missing the forest for the trees. I had been focusing on the superficial (getting promoted) instead of substantial (actually become a more skilled and valuable engineer).

I asked my boss not to promote me, and he said yes.

## Turning it around
After declining the promotion, I felt a ton of relief.

I felt like I had permission to slow down, learn things, and stop muddling through.

I'd been telling myself for months that I'd learn more about Go, but I never had the energy to do it when I got home -- my boss encouraged me to do it at work.

I started a morning routine of reading about Go (and eventually other topics) for 30 minutes before beginning work for the day. I started asking more questions. I felt like I had time to talk to other people and help them with their projects.

My absolute amount of knowledge hadn't changed substantially, but my trajectory had.

I went from standing still, to making progress.

Before, each new topic I encountered was a threat, showing me how little I currently knew. Now, each new topic I encountered was an opportunity. I may not have known about it at the moment, but I could learn it eventually.

## Moving forward
This change of perspective was a turning point in my career. It made working in software a lot more fun and has given me the space to indulge my curiousity.

I've made learning a core part of my work as a software engineer, and the way I make decisions about my career.

I'll write more about my current approach to learning in future posts. Until then!
