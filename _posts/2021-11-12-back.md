About 2 years since my last post, I decided to write this one. I'm currently taking the Bradfield CSI, and I was inspired by the blog of one of my classmates. Nothing fancy, but he had consistently written posts for the past year or so.

Reading back on the few posts I wrote when I started the blog, I'm cringing pretty hard. But perhaps that's an indicator of growth.

What's changed since then?

When I started the blog, I had recently finished a job search and started working as a SWE at Twitter. I had come off of a failing (at least according to me) to found a startup, and I had a lot of energy and enthusiasm for my career. But perhaps for the wrong reasons (money, "success"). This blog felt like another thing that would be good for me to do, and I even believed in the benefits of writing it. But as it turns out, I wasn't doing it for the right reasons, and I soon stopped writing as my work picked up. I also was hoping to write one post/week, which looking back seems highly ambitious.
