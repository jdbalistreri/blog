excerpt: "The benefits of starting an engineering blog"
---

Everyone says that if you're a software engineer, you should start a blog -- but few people actually do.

One of those people who actually does is [Chase Seibert](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/){:target="_blank"}, an engineering manager at Dropbox I met last winter when interviewing for a new role.

Before our interview, the recruiter sent me a link to Chase's blog, where he had outlined his [engineering philosophy](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2018/05/14/lets-work-together.html){:target="_blank"}. Reading this post instantly elevated Chase above other managers I had met, since I could see inside his head and imagine what it would be like to work together.

He's also got a [great post](https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/why-blogging.html){:target="_blank"} on why software engineers should start blogs. The key benefits he highlights are career growth, personal branding, and giving back to the engineering community.

For me, it's a combination of career growth and giving back that I find most motivating.

First, clear writing reflects clear thinking. Taking time to reflect on my ideas and publish them will help me clarify what I think and how I made decisions.

Second, I want to join the public intellectual discourse. Everything I've ever learned by reading has been written by someone. I hope this blog serves as a small step toward being a part of the ongoing conversation happening in books, blog posts, tweets, and other forms of public media.

My intent is to post to this blog on a weekly basis, and I'm planning to write my first few posts about my approach to learning as a software engineer. Stay tuned!

_Note: I've gratefully used Chase's blogging template to get up to speed quickly, and focus on the content of my blog, instead of the how of setting it up._
