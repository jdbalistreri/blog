<p>I decided recently to stop using my family’s shared Netflix account, and it’s helped me clarify my views around avoiding things that are artificially subsidized or free.</p>

<h2 id="background-on-the-netflix-account">Background on the Netflix account</h2>
<p>Many years ago, my family got a Netflix account that my parents, my three siblings, and I all shared. My parents originally paid for the account, and continued to do so, but they’d occassionally question if they should keep paying for a service used by their adult children.</p>

<p>When the topic would come up, my immediate, instinctive reaction would be “oh no, I hope they don’t stop paying for it!”</p>

<h2 id="the-hidden-cost-of-free">The hidden cost of free</h2>
<p>And that’s where the hidden costs come in. Netflix costs about $9/month, and I’m fortunate enough that I could pay for it on my own without it affecting my finances.</p>

<p>However, asking myself if I’d be willing to pay the full price for Netflix makes me question the entire premise.</p>

<p>Is watching Netflix something I want in my life?</p>

<p>Is it worth $9/month?</p>

<p>But most importantly, is it worth my time?</p>

<h2 id="my-true-preferences">My true preferences</h2>
<p>When it comes down to it, I’m not currently willing to spend the money for Netflix, because it’s not something I really value.</p>

<p>And in fact, the idea of not having access to Netflix excites me, thinking about the things I might do instead of watching TV.</p>

<p>And the reason I didn’t question it sooner is that I didn’t want to lose access to something “free”.</p>

<h2 id="you-get-a-car">You get a car</h2>
<p>Taking the point beyond this example, our society is full of seemingly free or subsidized stuff:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cheap food</li>
  <li>free or subsidized education</li>
  <li>free news</li>
  <li>free social media</li>
  <li>free porn</li>
  <li>free smartphone games</li>
</ul>

<p>This also applies to the dynamics of individual relationships (families, friendships, romantic relationships, employment arrangements, etc.)</p>

<h2 id="pay-the-full-price">Pay the full price</h2>
<p>So does this mean I should avoid anything that’s free?</p>

<p>No, I don’t think so. And I’m also not saying that being free makes something inherently bad.</p>

<p>Instead, I plan to ask myself if I’d be willing to pay the full price for anything I think I’m getting for free.</p>

<p>The most important part of that exercise is truly understanding what the full price is.</p>

<p>So for now, I’m done with Netflix. And if I ever change my mind, I can always pay the $9/month to get it back.</p>
