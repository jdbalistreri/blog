I"‹<p>Everyone says that if youâ€™re a software engineer, you should start a blog â€“ but few people actually do.</p>

<p>One of those people who actually does is <a href="https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/" target="_blank">Chase Seibert</a>, an engineering manager at Dropbox I met last winter when interviewing for a new role.</p>

<p>Before our interview, the recruiter sent me a link to Chaseâ€™s blog, where he had outlined his <a href="https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2018/05/14/lets-work-together.html" target="_blank">engineering philosophy</a>. Reading this post instantly elevated Chase above other managers I had met, since I could see inside his head and imagine what it would be like to work together.</p>

<p>Heâ€™s also got a <a href="https://chase-seibert.github.io/blog/2014/08/01/why-blogging.html" target="_blank">great post</a> on why software engineers should start blogs. The key benefits he highlights are career growth, personal branding, and giving back to the engineering community.</p>

<p>For me, itâ€™s a combination of career growth and giving back that I find most motivating.</p>

<p>First, clear writing reflects clear thinking. Taking time to reflect on my ideas and publish them will help me clarify what I think and how I made decisions.</p>

<p>Second, I want to join the public intellectual discourse. Everything Iâ€™ve ever learned by reading has been written by someone. I hope this blog serves as a small step toward being a part of the ongoing conversation happening in books, blog posts, tweets, and other forms of public media.</p>

<p>My intent is to post to this blog on a weekly basis, and Iâ€™m planning to write my first few posts about my approach to learning as a software engineer. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><em>Note: Iâ€™ve gratefully used Chaseâ€™s blogging template to get up to speed quickly, and focus on the content of my blog, instead of the how of setting it up.</em></p>
